-- View used because there are no functions in SQLite

-- locations table is the main table (because these are the locations being sold)
-- Because its SQLite we cannot do a check condition on the state abbreviations
	-- Because you cannot use subqueries in a check and no user-defined functions
		-- Okay you can but you have to make them in C first or add an extension
	-- In other Databases this would be easy but still past the course's objectives
-- postal codes include Guam (96910â€“96932) and others
-- unit numbers can be 127, 103, or "E" - so varchar
-- integer for cost is used because it's same as bigint with SQLite
-- note for smaller values you'd use cents but that makes these huge
	-- if calculations needed then split dollars and cents to different columns
