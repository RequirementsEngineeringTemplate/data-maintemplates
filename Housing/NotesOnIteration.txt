This is the inital iteration.
It simple creates the databases using DDL language and sets up inital foreign and primary keys. 

- Exception is stateabbreviations table (which is just pulled from government site and set).
- Its somewhat Normalized (its around 3.5) but hasn't fully been tested or planed.
- ERDs are created by BeaverDB (default settings) and will be replaced with full ones later
  - Beaver doesn't describe the cardinality by default (without adding conditions)
- Added picture of commands used to import a csv file with inital location data
