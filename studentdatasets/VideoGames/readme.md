# Where the data came from
The FullSteamTrends data was provided by two developers whose citation is in the first sheet of the workspace.
The backlog and cleaned sets were made from a [Kaggle user's raw datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/steam-games-complete-dataset) (each at 70+Mb in raw state).
The console and game sales datasets were provided by [GregorySmith](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/datasets)
