# Where the data came from:
I'm glad other compiled this, so great thanks to RAMANATHAN [at Kaggle for the Apple data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps?select=appleStore_description.csv) and LAVANYA for [the Google Play Store Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps).

The raw_appdata.csv file was made using [Google's Dataset API](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/fitness/data/DataSet) (during Lockdown in 2020) and has not been cleaned nor does it contain any comments/reviews.
